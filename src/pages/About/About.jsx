        I am a frontend developer with an eye for design. I am unabashedly in
        love with CSS, ThreeJS, and React Three Fiber (especially Drei!). But I
        also love playing around with data and seeing how that data can
        translate to the frontend, and have a firm belief that any design
        project must begin and end with understanding the backend. In my
        downtime you'll find me playing Cities: Skylines (a lot), working on my
        own projects, taking walks, working out, and when time and money permit,
        traveling. I enjoy experiencing different cultures and have a host of
        places that I want to visit.
